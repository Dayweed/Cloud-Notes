# Cloud-Notes
## Chapter 1
### What is cloud computing
* Cloud computing is a style of computing in which scalable and elastic IT-enabled capabilities are delivered as a service using internet technologies
### Why is it called Cloud
* Cloud is a group of networked elements providing services
### Pay as you Go (Pay per use)
* A form of cloud payment model that allows users to be charged according to the usage of cloud resources
### Benefits of Cloud Computing
* Benefits of cloud computing include flexibility, elasticity, cost efficiency, unlimited data storage for big data, backup and recovery, easy deployment

### Virtualization and Cloud Services
* Computer Resources / Infrastructure -> Virtualization ->Cloud Applications & Services

### Computer Virtualization
* Virtualization uses software to create an abstraction layer over computer hardware to divide a single computer - processors, memory, storage, network into m,ultiple smaller virtual units
* Virutalization hides the physical characteristics of computing resources from their users, supporting different applications/ services on top of them.

### Terminologies
* Virtualization: The technology which enables an abstraction level of resources, including virtual computers, storage device, computer network resources
* Hypervisor: A software that creates and runs virtual machines(VMs).
*  Virtual Machine: A software emulation of a physical computer

### Benefits of Virtualization
* Encapsulation and Isolation
* Cost Reduction
* Hardware Utilization
* Energy Saving
* Flexibility
* No hardware/ software lock-in
* Replication for recovery
* Quick Server Provisioning
